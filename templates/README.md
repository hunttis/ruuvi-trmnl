# Templates

Layout templates for TRMNL displays:

- `responsive.html` - **Recommended** - Adaptive layout that works across all screen sizes, orientations, and bit-depths
- `quadrant.html` - Compact layout for quarter-screen
- `half-horizontal.html` - For half-width displays
- `half-vertical.html` - For half-height displays
- `full.html` - Full screen layout

Copy template content into a TRMNL Private Plugin.

## Responsive Template

The `responsive.html` template uses TRMNL's responsive framework to automatically adapt to:
- **Screen sizes**: Small (600px+), Medium (800px+), Large (1024px+)
- **Orientation**: Landscape (default) and Portrait
- **Bit-depth**: 1-bit, 2-bit, and 4-bit displays

This single template replaces the need for separate layouts for different screen configurations.
